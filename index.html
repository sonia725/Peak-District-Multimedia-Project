        <h1>British Mountaineering Council fundraise to confront Peak District ‘Bog of Doom’</h1>

      <h2>A famous Peak District mountain bike trail has received national attention as part of a country-wide Mend our Mountains campaign. </h2>

      <p>A mountain biking ‘classic’ route, the Cut Gate trail cuts through uninhabited moorland and blanket bog in the dark peak area of the National Park. </p>

      <p>Mend our Mountains, a campaign run by the British Mountaineering Council (BMC) aimed to raise a million pounds in 2018 to improve 13 paths and trails nationwide, including two in the Peak District. </p>

      <p>The campaign will spend £70,000 of the raised money to improve the waterlogged and boggy areas of the Cut Gate bridleway. </p>

      <p>The problems with the track on Cut Gate was brought to the attention of the BMC by local mountain bike groups, including Peak District MTB, Keeper of the Peak and Ride Sheffield, who took the issue to land managers and stakeholders which led to the repair project as part of Mend our Mountains.
 </p>
      <p> Simon Bowns, one of the founding members of Ride Sheffield, said: “In general, Cut Gate holds up pretty well in bad weather conditions, with the exception of three areas that have become known as the Bog of Doom. </p>

      <p> “Improving drainage and encouraging a single line should allow the moorland to recover and give a route that’s easier to use even when it’s been wet in the area.”  </p>
      <p>Although a notorious route in the mountain biking community, the path is also used by walkers and horse riders and is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). </p>

    <p>Mr Bowns said: “We see it as vital to care and repair the routes and countryside that we enjoy – this is just one example.</p>

    <p>“Should the fundraising achieve what we’d like, there are plans for three short sections of trail repair. Mostly stonework and the all-important drainage work.” </p>

    <p>He added once the work was complete he hoped bikers, walkers and horse riders would be able to use the bridleway without having to make detours around the bog. </p>

    <p> “Once the moorland has time to recover, it should become an even more beautiful part of the Peak District,” he said.   </p>

    <p>Chris Maloney, a committee member at Peak District MTB and Keeper of the Peak, said: “It’s a hugely popular destination for mountain bikers across the country but it’s in a fragile state owing to how many users from all groups go up there.” </p>

    <p>He added it was important for mountain bikers to be involved in discussions about how the iconic trail is looked after as: “it demonstrates just how much we care about the Peak District and the places we ride.” </p>

        The Keeper of the Peak organisation has been keeping riders up to date on the condition of different routes through twitter to minimise the impact of mountain bikes on fragile areas of the Peak District.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr Maloney said, of when riders ask about the Cut Gate conditions: “Very rarely it’s an update which says ‘Cut Gate’s great, ride it’. Perhaps only after a baking few days or in a deep freeze.”
        </p>
        <p>
          He added it was a fine balance between looking after the track and keeping all users happy which was why they were working closely with Moors for the Future who will be doing the repair works to ensure the mountain bikers’ views would be represented. </p>
        <p>“It’s about protecting the environment really. In wet weather you just don’t go up there – the mountain bike community proactively discourages people riding up there,” said Mr Maloney. </p>
        <p>
        When asked about what the project will bring, he said: “People will no longer have to navigate deep, muddy bogs. People will see a defined, resilient section of track to use, but more importantly, it affects them now as we need the money to do it.”
        </p>
        <p>Diarmuid Crehan, project manager of the Cut Gate path at Moors for the Future, said: “As people walk off and try and find a less boggy route it tends to widen the area and you get more degradation of the moor and it also interferes with the bird breeding.”</p>
        <p>He added birds have tended to breed at a certain distance away from the path, so if the track is widened it would impact on them too.</p>
        <p>Previously, Moors for the Future carried out restoration works on Cut Gate in 2007-2008 to repair some of the most waterlogged sections, which Mr Maloney said were well-received but since then little had been done on the trail.</p>

      <section class="content">
         <p>Mr Crehan said: “If you restore some of the path, it attracts a lot of people onto the path, so the areas that you haven’t worked on probably get impacted even more. </p>

         <p>“There’s also quite a lot of archaeology because it’s not an area that’s been farmed, you get quite a lot of Neolithic and stone circles and that type of thing. </p>

         <p>“So, to be really careful and make sure you don’t destroy anything like that, we involve the architectural teams from the park.”</p>

         <p>Moors for the Future will look to do the repair works on Cut Gate in March of next year and will use a variety of different techniques.</p>
         <p>Moors for the Future will look to do the repair works on Cut Gate in March of next year and will look to add stone flags to the worst sections and stone pitching to other parts, whilst maintaining the character of the trail.</p>
